Hello! I am a third-year graduate student at Tsinghua University, where I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering under the guidance of  Professor [Ping Su](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/sp_en/main.htm). Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).



My research interests focus on computational imaging and optics, with a particular emphasis on imaging in complex media, such as deep biological tissue or 3D particle fields. I employ a variety of techniques to achieve clearer and deeper visualizations in scattering media, including super-resolution imaging, lensless on-chip microscopy, Fourier ptychography, digital holography, and deep learning based on simulator-training.

Hello! I am a new graduate student at UC Berkeley, working with Prof. [Laura Waller](http://www.laurawaller.com/). My research interest lies in computational imaging and optics and I am explorinig diffuser camera & microscope recently. I previously worked on None-line-of-sight imaging with Prof. [Andreas Velten](https://biostat.wisc.edu/~compoptics/). I play with signal processing in the Fourier domain a lot, and I always love combining physical hardware and computational methods to create something.
